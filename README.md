# Terminal Weather App

A simple Node.js CLI app to get current weather for any city using OpenWeatherMap.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
3. Copy your API key into the `.env` file:
   ```env
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the app:
```sh
npm start
```

You’ll be prompted to enter a city name. The app will display the current weather for that city.
